## Getting Started

To start the development server, use one of the following commands:

```sh
npm run dev

```

Once the server is running, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

### Project Structure

The project follows a standard Next.js structure:

```
/root
 ├── app/           
 │   ├── page.js     
 │   ├── layout.js  
 │   ├── globals.css
 ├── components/     
 ├── pages/          
 ├── public/         
 ├── styles/       
 ├── next.config.js 
 ├── package.json    
 ├── README.md    
```

### Editing the Project

You can start modifying the application by editing the following file:

```

Any changes made will automatically reflect in the browser thanks to Next.js' fast refresh feature.
